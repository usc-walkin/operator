# Recycling Vending Machine (REVCOIN)
The project `recycling-vending-machine` envisions a platform where people return the recyclables to get the `token` as compensation. 

## How it works
Users visit vending machines with recyclables to return. Vending machines scans SKUs (within barcode for example) and send it to the **operator** which then validates it and issues tokens. Token is not transferred directly to the person so that she does not have to provide her identity while returning the recyclables. She instead receives hash value which she can later use to actually get the token.
